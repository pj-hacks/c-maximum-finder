# c-maximum-finder
B
Description: This repository contains a C program that demonstrates the use of the fmax function from the math library to find the maximum value between two integers. 

The program showcases fundamental concepts of C programming, including the inclusion of libraries and basic arithmetic operations. 

It serves as a practical example for beginners learning C or anyone interested in understanding how to implement mathematical functions in programming.

Key Features:Implementation of fmax function to determine maximum value.

Basic arithmetic operations in C.Educational resource for learning C programming concepts.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a learning resource or as a basis for further experimentation with C programming.
